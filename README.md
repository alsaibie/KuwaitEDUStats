# Purpose

A collection of the the Kuwait's Secondary Education graduating class, for both public and private schools between the years 2011-2018. 
Note including American, US or other non public format private schools systems. 

The data sources are of various Kuwaiti Local Newspapers online archives which are: AlQabas, AlAnbaa, AlRai and KuwaitNews.

You can find more information on Kuwait's education system [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Kuwait#Intermediate_and_secondary_education)

The purpose of this repo is to keep a public and accessible collection of these results, and hopefully other Kuwait specific education statistics.

In the hope that they can be analyzed to give better insight and benchmarking of year-to-year performance.
